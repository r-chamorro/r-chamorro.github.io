    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm an experienced Business Administrator and data analyst with a background in systems engineering and over ten years of experience in call center environments. My skill set spans across process improvement, automation, and systems management.</p>
    <p>I've worked on a variety of projects, including data automation using VBA, SQL, and Excel to streamline workflows, reduce manual tasks, and improve data accuracy. My experience also includes managing HRIS and using SAP Business One for administrative management and process optimization.</p>
    <p>This repository is a showcase of some of the tools and solutions Iâ€™ve developed along my career journey. Right now, the projects here include Excel files that automate processes, but in the future, I will be adding SQL and Python projects as my portfolio expands.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>You can explore the files and tools I've been working on <a href="https://github.com/r-chamorro/currentProjects" target="_blank">here in my GitHub repository</a>. These projects include data management, reporting automation, and other solutions tailored for business processes.</p>

    <h2>Skills and Expertise</h2>
    <p>In addition to my technical skills in data analysis and automation, I have a Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt certification, which helps me approach problem-solving and process improvement with an efficiency-driven mindset.</p>
